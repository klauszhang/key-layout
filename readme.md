# Karabiner config generator

This is just used for my Keychron k12 keyboard.

Keymaps config is [here](https://github.com/klauszhang/key-layout/blob/master/config.js)

If you want to use it, please consider updating the device ids [here](https://github.com/klauszhang/key-layout/blob/master/index.js#L19) to match your device.

## How to

You would need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) to run it

After you got NodeJS installed, just run

```bash
$ node .
```

### NOTE

It would write to your Karabiner config, please make sure you have a backup.

## Thanks

[Karabiner](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) - First time use it. As good as it could be.

[Karabiner Complex Modification](https://genesy.github.io/karabiner-complex-rules-generator/) provides me inspiration. My k12 is now much useful than it was.

[Keychron](https://www.keychron.com/) creates this keyboard. It is affordable, simple, and quality. I enjoy the lighting, fancy! I have no complaints.

My k12 is a bit wobble on a flat surface, hot glue fixed it.
