# Karabiner config generator

This is just used for my Keychron k12 keyboard.

If you like it, feel free to download and use it.

Keymaps config is [here](https://github.com/klauszhang/key-layout/blob/master/config.js)

If you think the code is messy, you have my apologies. It seems working. Hopefully, it would get better in the future.

If you want to make it works for you, consider updating the device ids [here](https://github.com/klauszhang/key-layout/blob/master/index.js#L19)

Thanks for [Karabiner Complex Modification](https://genesy.github.io/karabiner-complex-rules-generator/) for inspiration. My k12 is now much useful than it was.
